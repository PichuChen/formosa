FREEBSD
--------

1. If you want to set the bbs in chroot environment,
   you need:

    /usr/share/misc/termcap
    /usr/share/misc/termcap.db

   just copy or mount these file onto the bbs home directory.

2.  ## please use des-crypt ##

   Because FreeBSD default use md5-crypt, not des-crypt,
   with our bbs program, please use des-crypt, you need not
   change your system library, just take a copy of 'libdescrypt.a',
   when linking the bbs program, make the lib file visible.
