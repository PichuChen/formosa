Chapter 2. Source Installation on Unix systems

	The initial FBCE setup and configuration process is controlled by the
	use of the command line options of the configure script. You could get
	a list of all available options along with short explanations running
	./configure --help. Our manual documents the different options
	separately. You will find the core options in the appendix, while the
	different extension specific options are descibed on the reference
	pages.

	When FBCE is configured, you are ready to build the module and/or
	executables. The command make should take care of this. If it fails
	and	you can't figure out why, see the Problems section.

	Prerequisite software for compiling:

		* An ANSI C compiler
		* autoconf: version 2.61+
		* automake: version 1.10+

	Support platforms:

		* Gentoo/Linux
		* Debian GNU/Linux
		* FreeBSD
